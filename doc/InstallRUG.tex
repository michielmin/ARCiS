\section{Introduction}


\subsection{Terms of use}

By using ARCiS you agree to the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item If in doubt on any of the results, you consult with me. Email: M.Min@sron.nl
\item You cite the appropriate papers listed below.
\end{itemize}
The most important reason for this is to make sure that ARCiS is used in a correct way and the result are scientifically useful. ARCiS is a complex code which can do a lot of things, this also means things can go wrong. Please refer to \cite{2020A&A...642A..28M} for the first full description of the fundamental properties of the code.

Note that there are several parts of the code from different developers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cloud formation framework: \cite{2019A&A...622A.121O}
\item Optical properties of cloud particles computed using DHS: \cite{2005A&A...432..909M, 1981ApOpt..20.3657T}
\item Refractive indices for the cloud species, see references in \cite{2020A&A...642A..28M}
\item Molecular opacities: \cite{2021A&A...646A..21C} and references therein
\item Multinest Retrieval tools: \cite{2008MNRAS.384..449F, 2009MNRAS.398.1601F, 2019OJAp....2E..10F}
\item GGchem when including chemistry: \cite{2018A&A...614A...1W}
\item Disequilibrium chemistry implementation: \cite{2021A&A...656A..90K}
\item Diffusion implementation for 3D structures: \cite{2022A&A...665A...2C}
\item Coupling with planet formation parameters: \cite{2022A&A...667A.147K}
\end{itemize}

\section{Installing ARCiS at the computers of Kapteyn}

ARCiS is installed on the computers of Kapteyn by the computer group. The version number can be found at the top of the log file when running ARCiS.
To setup your computer for running ARCiS you need to only link to the location of the Data directory. This can be done as follows:

First go to your home directory:
\shellcmd{cd}
Next, make the ARCiS directory:
\shellcmd{mkdir ARCiS}
Now link the data directory to the right location:
\shellcmd{cd ARCiS}
\vspace{-2cm}\\
\shellcmd{ln -s /dataserver/users/formingworlds/ARCiSData ./Data}

Now when you want to run ARCiS, all you have to do is:
\shellcmd{module load ARCiS}

and you are good to go!
